# Vercel SPA Routing Fix

## 🚨 Error: `GET https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/products 404 (Not Found)`

This error occurs because Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## 🔧 Root Cause:
When you navigate to `/products` directly or refresh the page, Vercel tries to find a physical file at that path. Since it's a React SPA, all routes should be handled by the `index.html` file.

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### Updated `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    // ... environment variables
  }
}
```

### Key Addition:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

## 🔍 What This Does:

1. **Catches All Routes**: The `"source": "/(.*)"` pattern matches any URL path
2. **Redirects to index.html**: All requests are redirected to `/index.html`
3. **Enables Client-Side Routing**: React Router can then handle the routing

## 🚀 Expected Result:

After this fix:
- ✅ **Direct URL access works**: `/products`, `/about`, `/contact`, etc.
- ✅ **Page refresh works**: No more 404 errors
- ✅ **All routes accessible**: Admin routes, user routes, etc.
- ✅ **SEO friendly**: Search engines can crawl all pages

## 📋 Routes That Will Work:

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | Home page |
| `/products` | Products listing |
| `/product/:id` | Product details |
| `/about` | About page |
| `/contact` | Contact page |
| `/login` | User login |
| `/signup` | User signup |
| `/profile` | User profile |
| `/orders` | User orders |
| `/admin` | Admin dashboard |
| `/admin/products` | Admin products |
| `/admin/orders` | Admin orders |
| `/admin/coupons` | Admin coupons |

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions:

### Option 1: _redirects file (Netlify style)
Create `public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## ✅ Verification:
After deployment, test these URLs:
- [https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/products](https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/products)
- [https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/about](https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/about)
- [https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/admin](https://recon-autobots.vercel.app/admin)

All should load without 404 errors!
